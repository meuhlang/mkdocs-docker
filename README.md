A simple docker wrapper for [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

Thoses extra features are installed :

- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

## Versionning

Since [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/about/release-notes/) seams to use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/),
we will use the format `v<mkdoc version>-<our version>`.

For example :

| Mkdocs version | Our release version | Final version |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1.2.2          | 0                   | v1.2.2-0      |
| 1.2.2          | 1                   | v1.2.2-1      |
| 1.2.3          | 0                   | v1.2.3-1      |
